Project Title:  
The Cringe Collection :Awkward Moments

Project Overview:
This project compiles an all-inclusive and very relatable list of awkward moments people generally experience in daily life. It's going to be a funny, entertaining resource that will help people laugh over the shared awkwardness of human interaction. It can be a funny article, social media content, or even a small interactive app where users can add their own awkward moments.

Key Features:

Categorized Moments: Create awkward moments categories, like social settings, work environments, public transport, etc.
User Submissions: Include user submissions for adding more of their awkward moments
Funny GIFs or Memes: Include images or memes that depict each awkward moment to add a comedic touch
Voting System: Enables users to vote on which awkward moment they find the most relatable or funny.
Search/Filter: Enable the user to search for their favorite embarrassing, funny, or awkward moments by keywords, categories, or even more personal moods.
Social Sharing: Share favourite moments to various social media sites.


Tech Stack:


Front-end: React will be used in building the web frontend; Tailwind CSS will be used in styles
Back-end: Node.js and Express.js will be used in handling user submissions and interactions.
Database: MongoDB will be used to manage the list of awkward moments, user-generated content, and votes.
Authentication: Firebase or Auth0 for user sign-in and submission tracking.
Hosting/Cloud: Vercel for front-end hosting, and Heroku for backend.

Why This Project:
I chose this project because awkward moments are a universal experience, and I think people would enjoy a space where they can laugh and share their stories. It’s a light-hearted project that also presents an opportunity to improve my web development skills. By working on it, I’ll gain experience in user interaction, database management, and API development while working on a fun and interactive application.
